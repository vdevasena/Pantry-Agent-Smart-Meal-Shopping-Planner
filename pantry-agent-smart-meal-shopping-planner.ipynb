I’m starting from my apartment at 210 10th St, Jersey City, New Jersey and I don’t have a car, so I’ll either walk or use delivery depending on the weather. I’m okay with eating chicken, eggs, rice, tomatoes, ginger, and some veggies, and I want breakfast, lunch, snacks, and dinner ideas. Please tell me what I should buy in the next 2 days and create a 5-day healthy meal plan using those ingredients.\"\n    )\n\n    user_id = \"demo_user\"\n    session_id = \"pantry_session\"\n    await session_service.create_session(\n        app_name=runner.app_name,\n        user_id=user_id,\n        session_id=session_id,\n    )\n\n    content = types.Content(\n        role=\"user\",\n        parts=[types.Part(text=user_msg)],\n    )\n\n    final_plan_text = None\n\n    async for event in runner.run_async(\n        user_id=user_id,\n        session_id=session_id,\n        new_message=content,\n    ):\n        if event.is_final_response() and event.content and event.content.parts:\n            final_plan_text = event.content.parts[0].text\n\n    print(\"\\n=== Final Plan ===\\n\")\n    print(final_plan_text)\n\nawait demo()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-28T20:53:01.615573Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-28T20:53:01.615934Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-28T20:53:33.384848Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-28T20:53:01.615906Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-28T20:53:33.383782Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\n=== Final Plan ===\n\nHere’s a summary of your 5-day healthy meal plan!
